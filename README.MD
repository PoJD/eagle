# eagle
Custom Eagle library with components bought online or in czech shop gme.cz to be used within the custom PCBs (see https://github.com/PoJD/can-pcb )
Created following https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/110

There are other parts in this library though, therefore the library name is PoJD.lbr from now on (e.g. microchip components there now too)
